# Part II: Designing Programs

Now that you've grasped the basics of programming in JavaScript, we'll level up your program analysis and design skills. First, you'll build on the knowledge about algorithms you've already gained. We'll dig into some more complicated algorithms, and also see how to analyze algorithms for efficiency. Then we'll look at common data structures and how to design the data in your own applications. Then we'll take a deep dive into how to design programs. Finally, we'll put it all together with one of the most complex projects for any developer: we'll create our own programming language.
