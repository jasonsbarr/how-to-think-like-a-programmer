# Part III: Intermediate JavaScript Features

In this section we'll cover more JavaScript features that are important for you to know. First, you'll learn the ins and outs of working with strings, including a very important object for working with strings: regular expressions. Next, you'll learn how to create your own iterators, as well as how to use a new kind of function in ES2015 called *generators*. Then you'll learn how to work with serialized data and files so you can build your own database. Finally, there's a project so you can showcase what you've learned in this section.
