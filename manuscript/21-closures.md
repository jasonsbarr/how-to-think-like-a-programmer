# More Advanced Programming

In this section we'll take the deepest plunge yet into JavaScript features and the runtime execution model. We'll also build on our knowledge of algorithms and data structures from earlier, and work on some advanced problem solving skills. Finally, we'll tie the whole book together with a massive final project that will be worthy of any portfolio.
