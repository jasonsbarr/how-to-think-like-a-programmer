# Part III: Algorithms and Program Design

Now that you've grasped the basics of programming in JavaScript, we'll level up your program analysis and design skills. First, you'll build on the knowledge about algorithms you've already gained. We'll dig into some more complicated algorithms and data structures, and also see how to analyze algorithms for efficiency. Then you'll learn about testing and writing tests, so you can make your applications as bulletproof as possible. Then we'll take a deep dive into program design and problem solving. Finally, we'll put it all together with one of the most complex projects for any developer: we'll create our own programming language.
