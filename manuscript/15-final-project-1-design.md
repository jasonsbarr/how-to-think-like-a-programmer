# Final Project: A Kanban Project Manager

Now is where it all comes together. We're going to build a huge project that will fit nicely in any portfolio, and also give you the experience of working on a bigger application from design to deployment. We'll use several useful packages from NPM along the way, and you'll get experience with professional build tools and a development server as well. You'll see all the steps here, including the less glamorous parts (like testing) and the most important parts (like testing). At the end you'll have something you can be proud of.
