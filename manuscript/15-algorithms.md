# Thinking Like A Programmer

We've covered a lot in the 1st 2 parts of this book! In this section we'll expand on everything you've learned so far and start really making the book earn its title. Sure, we've talked quite a bit already about designing programs, engineering, and algorithms, but in this part we'll take all that up a notch. You'll learn about some of the most important algorithms and data structures you can use in your projects, more about analyzing and designing algorithms, testing your projects, breaking down a problem into pieces and constructing a solution in depth, and how to solve any programming problem you come across, whether that's in interviews or on the job.
