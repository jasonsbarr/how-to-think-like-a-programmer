# Intermediate JavaScript Programming

In this section we'll cover more JavaScript topics that are important for you to know. We'll cover how to work with strings like a pro, making your own custom iterators, asynchronous programming (which allows you to have multiple things going on at once in your applications), and how to program web applications. Then we'll take a deeper look at algorithms, especially designing and analyzing algorithms for efficiency. Finally, we'll wrap it all up with a project.
