# Part V: Final Project

Now it's time to put everything you've learned throughout this book to work. We'll use all your JavaScript knowledge, algorithms and data structures, and app development skills in this final project. You'll build a fully-featured interpreter for your very own programming language, along with a Web-based IDE and server-side runtime. This is a massive project that will make an amazing addition to your portfolio.
